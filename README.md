# previously today...

A web application for people who want to know what historical trivia occurred today

This project was begun as a way to learn how to utilize a public API online and present it as
useful information to a user. Information was taken from numbersapi.com, and experimenting
with information organized by dates felt like a good way to understand data organization
within javascript, both in terms of how to parse it from the api and how to save it as easily
retrievable information to be displayed to a user again later. This also was a first attempt at
creating a responsive webpage using only native html, css, and javascript.
